                    <p>     Hi, my name is Amar, I have an A.A.S degree in game design.
                        I enjoy learning new things that can boost my skills or anything that I have not experienced.
                        Enjoy working in groups, and getting to learn others thought processes is useful.
                        Am capable of adapting to situations. 
                        when I started to learn to code I enjoyed seeing how users interacted with it.
                        As for designing I had fun mapping out and seeing the final product.
                        My goal is to make a unique user experience for the users of any product.</p>
